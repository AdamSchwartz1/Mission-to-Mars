# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use web scraping to gather data about Mars from multiple sites and employ it to a website that I created. Once all of the data was formatted correctly on our webpage, I used 3 Bootstrap elements to make the site more appealing. I turned the scrape button to a different color, centered the titles for the Mars featured image and Mars facts table, and I changed the paragraph in the Mars Latest News section to 'lead' format to make it stand out more.

### Applications used:
